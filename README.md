# An Analysis of Campaign Fundraising Performance

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to identify how different campaigns performed relative to their launch dates and funding goals. This was achieved by evaluating data of theater campaigns based on the month in which they were launched and the outcome- successful, failed, or canceled. Data was also analyzed to compare fundraising goals and campaigns outcomes.

Table 1 shows the number of successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns by the month in which the campaigns were launched. 
At first glance, we can see that more campaigns were launched in May than any other month, with a total of 166. May also saw the most successful (111) and failed (52) campaigns.
