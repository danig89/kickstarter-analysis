# An Analysis of Campaign Fundraising Performance

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to identify how different campaigns performed relative to their launch dates and funding goals. This was achieved by evaluating data of theater campaigns based on the month in which they were launched and the outcome- successful, failed, or canceled. Data was also analyzed to compare fundraising goals and campaigns outcomes.
## Analysis and Challenges

Table 1 shows the number of successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns by the month in which the campaigns were launched. At first glance, we can see that more campaigns were launched in May than any other month, with a total of 166. May also saw the most successful (111) and failed (52) campaigns.

Table 2 displays the percentage of the outcomes based on the total number of campaigns launched, and for launches that took place in May and June. Sixty-seven percent of campaigns launched in May were successful, 31% failed, and 2% were canceled. June was also a popular month for launching campaigns, with 153 total; 65% were successful, 32% failed, and 3% were canceled. The most cancellations happened for those campaigns launched in December. Successful campaigns accounted for 61% of the total campaigns launch during the year; 36% failed and 3% were canceled.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
